      <h1>As i said before, hi stranger!</h1>

      <h3>You are welcome here. Take a sit and grab a beer.</h3>
<p>My name is Matias Semelman, and I'm a Front-End React Developer from Argentina!</p>
<p><strong>You will be asking, why this dev. has his GitHub almost blank?</strong> Well... I'll be starting from the very bottom of the programming, just to re-learn what I know to the date.</p>

<p>This website will be my bitacore, my Holy Grial, my portfolio and my Operations Command Center.</p>

<p>I will be updating it in <strong>REAL TIME</strong>, with all I'm learnings and aplying each one. <strong>I'll be doing this in a Virtual Machine, using Ubuntu for the moment and, if I'm in mood, maybe I'll switch to Kali (to learn some pentesting).</strong> </p>
