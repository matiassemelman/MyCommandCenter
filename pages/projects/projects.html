  <h1>My projects</h1>
  <h2>To better understanding and retaining in my mind each technology and topic, I think the best way to do it is dividing my learning in two parts.</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>In the first hours of learned a complete topic or a part of it (depends on the complexity) :</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make Webpages/websites in a row with what I learned (surely reviewing the source).</li>
    <li>Keep going with the next topic.</li>
    <li>Adding the new topics to the first websites to practice.</li>
    <li>Making other Webpages/websites from scratch, joining all.</li>
  </ol> 

  <h3>Passed a day, starting the day with the making of new webpages from scratch with the learned the previous day. This will strengthen my memory and improve my practice.</h3>
